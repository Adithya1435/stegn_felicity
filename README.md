#                   Steganography CTF

A steganography ctf where you have to find a flag hidden in the image

Flag Format : flag{s0m3_c0d3_h4r4}

Can you find the flags hidden there?

Thank you felicity/nVision for giving me a great oppurtunity to make these questions!

P.S: Cyberchef is a great tool which might help you solving these!
